# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      welcome: Welcome to the music collection site!
      introduction: |
        Welcome to the music collection website! Here you can add albums, tracks,
        and review each track!
      info: |
        This website uses 3 models. Album, Track and Review. Each album can
        contain tracks, and each track can have reviews. The websites front-end relies
        a lot on bootstrap. JQuery is used as form validation in the contact us form, and
        also here on the homepage for the slide animation. The reviews index path has been
        removed since there is no point in listing all reviews without their tracks.
        I have also added a helper method that calculates an average rating given a track.
        I have localised most strings too. I have also used github.
